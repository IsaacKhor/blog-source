My name is Isaac Khor, and I've been writing software, both big and small,
since 2012. I have experience in most major areas of software engineering,
from embedded programming, time-sensitive networking, and kernel hacking.

I am currently interested in pursuing a PhD in systems; my research interest
lies mainly in distributed and operating systems, specifically in unikernels,
edge computing, containerisation, fault tolerant systems, and
virtualisation.

I currently work as a Graduate Trainee at Intel Malaysia as part of the HPC
team and plan to pursue a PhD in Computer Science starting Fall 2022.
