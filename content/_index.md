My name is Isaac Khor, and I've been writing software, both big and small,
since 2012. I have experience in most major areas of software engineering,
from embedded programming, time-sensitive networking, and kernel hacking.

I am currently pursuing a PhD in systems. My research interest lies mainly in
distributed and operating systems, specifically in unikernels, edge computing,
containerisation, fault tolerant systems, virtualisation, and storage systems.
